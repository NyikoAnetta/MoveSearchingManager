# MoveSearchingManager
Project to assess the technical level

ï»¿Backend Development Assignment - Nyiko Anetta

I've started working on the project on 27th of May, but I'm completely new int the MongoDB, so I've started with learning.
</br>I've checked some MongoDB tutorials at 27th and 28th of May, after my normal working hours.
</br>I started the actual development on Saturday morning.  In total at the weekend I've worked approximative 12 hours.
</br>At Monday I created the Git repository, and I worked a little bit in the ReportPerDay function. (approx. 4 hours) I didn't follow the branching strategy, cause I worked at my local machine, and I put the code to the repo when it was mostly done.

Comments:
</br> &emsp;- Firstly I've thought that in the Movie.cs class I'll split the different properties in arrays (ie. Genre, Writer, Actors), but I kept the given version.
</br> &emsp;- The same problem with the Movie.cs class Date property (Released), I'm not sure if every value are unified in the database, so I kept in string.
</br> &emsp;- I've made the simple mongoDB query functions Generic for reusability reason.
</br> &emsp;- I made two controllers based on security.
</br> &emsp;- I wrote some unit tests, but just for the MovieSearchingController. I'm still have a lot to learn about the TDD, especially about the data mocking, but I tried to create my application unit testable for the future.
</br> &emsp;- An update suggestion is to separate the generic functions for mongoDB operations in a class, and we can use this class as a parent class, and derive the specific classes from it.
